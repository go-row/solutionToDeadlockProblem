# solutionToDeadlockProblem
This repository contains C++ implementation of solution to deadlock problem using Bankers' Algorithm along with Safety prediction algorithm.

*****************************************************************************************************************************

>Deadlock detection using Banker's algorithm : A deadlock detection algorithm is correct if it satisfies two conditions: 1) every deadlock is eventually detected (ba- sic progress property), and 2) every detected deadlock really exists, i.e., only genuine deadlocks are detected (safety prop- erty). While the first condition is intuitive, the second one needs to be explained.
