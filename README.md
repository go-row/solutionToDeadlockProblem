# solutionToDeadlockProblem
This repository contains C++ implementation of solution to deadlock problem using Bankers' Algorithm along with Safety prediction algorithm.

*****************************************************************************************************************************

>Deadlock detection using Banker's algorithm : A deadlock detection algorithm is correct if it satisfies two conditions: 1) every deadlock is eventually detected (basic progress property), and 2) every detected deadlock really exists, i.e., only genuine deadlocks are detected (safety property). While the first condition is intuitive, the second one needs to be explained.
